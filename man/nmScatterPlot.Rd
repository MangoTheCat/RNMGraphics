\description{
  Generates a set of scatter plots with features that are tailored for PK/PD data generated by NONMEM.

\arguments{
  \item{obj}{An object of class NMRun, NMProblem, or data.frame. The object from which data will be plotted.}
  \item{xVars}{A character vector or comma-seperated string of x-variables. Names of the variables to plot on x-axes.}
  \item{yVars}{Variables to plot on the y-axes, specified the same way as xVars}
  \item{bVars}{“Trellis” variables on which to split data.}
  \item{gVars}{“Grouping” variable – used to group points by colour, for legends and so on.}
  \item{iVars}{Variable name of the “inherent grouping” variable.  This affects plots whose type is "l", "i" or "t".}
  \item{addLegend}{Should legends be added?}
  \item{addGrid}{ should grids be added?}
  \item{addLoess}{ should a loess smoother line be added? }
  \item{titles}{ Plot title }
  \item{logX}{Should the x-axis be logged?}
  \item{logY}{similar to logX for y axis}
  \item{idLines}{ Should reference lines of slope 1 and y-intercept 0 be added? }
  \item{abLines}{ Unused at the moment.}
  \item{xLab}{  x-axis label. }
  \item{yLab}{ similar to the above, but for y-axis labels }
  \item{types}{Plot types to use.  Allowed types are "p" (for standard points), "l" (lines connected by the variablespecified in "iVars", "i" for points labeled by "iVars", and "t" for labels connected by lines grouped by "iVars"}
  \item{overlaid}{Logical flag. If TRUE, for each fixed x, the y variables will be overlaid onto a single plot }
  \item{equalAxisScales}{ ~~Describe \code{equalAxisScales} here~~ }
  \item{layout}{ * }
  \item{maxPanels}{ * }
  \item{maxTLevels}{ * }
  \item{yAxisRelations}{ * }
  \item{problemNum}{ * }
  \item{subProblems}{ * }
  \item{\dots}{ Additional variables passed to the xyplot function }
